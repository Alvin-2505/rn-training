## What did I learn today? ##

**CSS Note**

  - When adding `flex: 1` to the most parent wrapping element, you are telling the element to only use the actual visible screen estate to display.

    - *Do this when some of your contents got cut off by the screen*

  - Alternatively, we could replace the parent `view` element with an empty element `<>` `</>`. This is to let React know that not to let the content go out of the screen

**Destructuring**

  - Destructuring is very complicated to me, thanks to Janan explanation, I am able to understand better now. Destructuring is like **extracting the properties of the object**, so that you can access this properties easier.

  - For example, a destructured props could be accessed using props right away, (i.e. `imageSource`, `title`, `rating`, `review`)
  
  ```const ResultsDetails = ({title, imageSource, rating, review}:ResultProp) => {                       return (                                                                                            <View style = {style.container}>                                                                   <Image style = {style.image} source={{uri: imageSource}}/>                                          <Text style = {style.title}>{title}</Text>                                                          <Text>{rating} stars, {review} ratings</Text>                                                           </View>)}```

  - If there is no destructuring in line 1, I would have to code as `props.title` to access the properties.

**Recapping on the Props System**

  - create a reusable component, `export` so that your screen could `import` and access it.

  - Then in your screen pass in the `props` of this component in which the component script will then access these props and format the output using JSX.

**useNavigation Hook**

  - the useNavigation hook allows you to access the `navigation` object props. [Source](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-navigation/)

  - As I could not find the withNavigation() so I checked with Willy and he pointed me to this hook.

  - Upon applying the hook, there is a type declaration error highlighted by TypeScript.

  - I went to search on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64296407) to check on how others fixed this. So this solution's focus is to declare what this Navigation object will require in this case. In our case, `navigation` will call on function `navigate` based on a parameter `destination` which is of a `string`. And for the return type of this function, I stated it to be `undefined` this is to follow the `RootStackParamList`. So now we need to call on the `useNavigation` to initialise the variable `navigation` with the property of a React Navigation props.

  ` const navigation: Navigation = useNavigation(); `

  - And then we will then be able to use the functionality of React's Navigation, my code to access is as follows:

  `<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => navigation.navigate('ResultsShowScreen')}>`

## Any issues I encounter? ##

**useLogin Hook**

- I am not very sure what does the `navigate` does at the bottom of the code (line 19)

<img src = './img/useLogin.png' height = '300' />

**declare type for `navigation` props**

<img src = './img/navigationProps.png' height = '300' />
