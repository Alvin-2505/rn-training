### Setting Up the Front End App to link up with the Back End ###

- AsyncStorage
  - Helps us to store a certain piece of data into the device
  - In this case, we used it to store our JSONWebToken so user can use this to auto Sign In
  - When we click sign out we will set the token as `null` to remove the token so user would have to sign in on the next time they open the app

- `SafeAreaView`
  - so that we will display the content within the screens' dimension.
  - If we wrap our navigation container in the `SafeAreaProvider`, it will help us to detect if the device has a notch and will avoid displaying content at the area.

- Create a Map component to display our Map portion in the Track Create Screens
  - using `react-native-maps` [library](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps)
    - default Map provider for IOS: Apple Maps
    - after installing the node packages, `cd ios && pod install`
    - quit the app and rebuild the app
    - run `npm run ios`

- To join a series of points:
  - use `<Polyline />`, wrapped in between `<MapView></MapView>`

- To track user current location:
  - use the community [library](https://github.com/michalchudziak/react-native-geolocation) `@react-native-community/geolocation`
  - Have followed an [advice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44424092/location-services-not-working-in-ios-11) set up the Info.plist to include:
  ```<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>                                                          <string>Program requires GPS to track cars and job orders</string>  <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>                                                   <string>Program requires GPS to track cars and job orders</string>                      <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>                                                          <string>Program requires GPS to track cars and job orders</string>```
