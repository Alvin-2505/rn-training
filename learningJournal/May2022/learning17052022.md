**Fixing up the Context Portion for usage in Blog App**

I rewatched the video to try to catch if I missed any details or concept.

*Step 1*

We will use the `createContext(defaultValue)` function from React,

*Step 2*

Create a Provider for the context, in this case `BlogProvider` this will be needed for us to wrap around the `children`                                   ```<BlogProvider value>                                                       {children}                                                                            </BlogProvider>```

The `value` is the data which you would wish to share with your components.

*Step 3*

In the component screen which you would wish to use the context, 

`import {useContext} from 'react';` this hook is to allow your screen to be able to access the data you input in your `value` props earlier in the `<BlogProvider>`.

Example:
`const value = useContext(BlogContext);`

*Main Concept in the Context so far*

You wish to pass in a data in your context, so that you could pass it into the children without duplicating the codes multiple times. 

*When you want to display an object*

Use the Flatlist element instead of Text as Text is only meant primitive data types instead of objects
