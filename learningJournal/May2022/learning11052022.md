**Passing Params to Routes**

*[Source](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/params/)*

There are various ways to pass the params to your routes, and this ways are based on your react navigation version. As the Udemy video is using an older version, I could not follow his way to pass in the param to be accepted in another screen. 

I went to the docs and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60769220/typeerror-props-navigation-getparam-is-not-a-function-inprops-navigation-get) for more insights on how can I pass params.

It works fine, my console is showing the different ID based on the restaurants I clicked into.

*Code Snippet*

<img src = './img/codeSnippet1.png' height = '300' />

Whenever we are rendering an object as state, the initial value should be `null`. > meaning we have not yet fetched any data.
