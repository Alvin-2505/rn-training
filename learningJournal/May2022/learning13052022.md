- [x]**Trying to do up the location searchbar**

  I have tried to do the dynamic search bar for location, as I understand that one of the parameter is requiring location or latitude and longitude. Hence, I was a little confused on the requirement of the dynamic location searchbar.

  But later on, I think I can create another location search bar component which will have a state based on user's input then I will transfer the state over to the location parameter in the original searchbar component.

  ***Update on 13May2022*** 

  I have created another component for the searchLocationBar and need to do some edit in the `searchApi` body as `location` param has been stated as a country by us. Hence, we could create a `location state` such that it would accept user's input in the `searchLocationBar` and then use this state to use as the `location` param. This could help us to keep the search function dynamic based on location

- []**Doing more exercises for TypeScript**

  I realised that I am not very proficient in TypeScript, so I have to spend time to strengthen the foundation of TypeScript. And I am trying to improve on my typing by doing the Exercises on [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises). It is not perfect in their questions clarity but it is free and it can be done using their online editor.

  ***Update as of 13 May 2022***

  Still practising during free time, keep trying to be proficient and not to be overconfident.
