**Blog App**

*Extracting the form field*

As the Create and Edit Page has similar form fields components to accept inputs, we could minimise the amount of duplicated codes by extracting them into a reusable components.

Important to note what are the common props we would wish to pass in through the components so that data could be transmitted through the props - `onSubmit action`, `initialValues`, `label(?)`

*`defaultProps` have been deprecated in React*

In order to pass in default values for the initial title and content, instead of using `defaultProp` we have to pass these as default parameters:

`const BlogPostForm = ({onSubmit, initialValues={initialTitle:'', initialContent:''}}) => {}`

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47774695/react-functional-component-default-props-vs-default-parameters/56443098#56443098)

*To navigate back to the previous view*

We could make use of the `navigation.pop()` function to navigate back to the previous view.

*`.find()`*

`const blogPost = state.find((blogPost)=> blogPost.id === id);`

The `Array.find()` method helps us to find the first element that pass the requirement of `blogPost.id === id`.

In this case the element we want is `blogPost`. Which consist of an `id`, `title` and `content`.

[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)

*`.map()`*

```case 'edit_blogpost':                                                                                        return state.map((blogPost)=>{                                                                                  return blogPost.id === action.payload.id ? action.payload : blogPost;                                                 });```

The Array.map()method creates a new array populated with a result of the calling function. So for the above code, the state array will be mapped with a function which calls for a match if the id of the editted post is same as the uneditted post, then we will return the new blog post with the edits to replace the existing blogpost in the array.
