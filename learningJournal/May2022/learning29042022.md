<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today? ##
----
<!-- Type what you learnt here -->
### Timeline of Designing and Developing ###

- Designing typically 2 sprints ahead of the Developing.

### React Native ###

- Today I am trying to start a new RN project so as to build a project from scratch

  - I am following the Udemy videos to kickstart the building of the new React Native Project

  - I have encountered some error message saying connection timeout after i install navigation library and trying to run ios

    - I resolve it by deleting Expo Go app on iOS simulator

    - then run `npm run ios` 

- Learning to do a splash screen in before transiting into the login page
  
  - Thinking of doing a component screen which will feature the image carousel using the `react-native-snap-carousel` package.

  - I have used the third party image carousel library to implement an image carousel

  - I also went to find to watch Youtube on how to navigate between screens as I created a new RN project

  - I went on to try and implement gradient color effect into the CSS, it is also from a third party library
  
## Any issues I encounter? ##

<!-- Type Your Issues Faced today Here -->
**Challenge From Yesterday**
I am trying to add in password validation and usage of use reducer into the password exercise yesterday.
However, when I am doing a test by typing, it kept prompting me as password field is empty whenever i type an alphabet.

  - **UPDATE**

    I have fixed the issue by recoding the code and changing my switch statement. earlier, my switch statement will keep prompt a validation whenever i key in something. Henceforth, I need to set a switch case in the reducer function to accept the user's input.

  - **Lesson Learnt** 

    I have to think more systematically as I didn't think of how will the system accept input inbefore i implement the authentication steps.

    <img src = './img/useReducerFixed.png' height = '300' />

**I encountered issues of putting in images into the carousel and making it appear**

  - I resolved it by implementing a height and width for the image

## Snippets ##

**Front Page**

<img src = './img/frontPage.png' height = '300' />

**Second Page**

<img src = './img/secondPage.png' height = '300' />
