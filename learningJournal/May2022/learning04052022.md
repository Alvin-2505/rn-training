**Issue 1**

I tried to create a new bare React Native project for the Restaurant App, Upon adding the Navigations codes, it prompted an error: `[react-native-gesture-handler] react-native-gesture-handler module was not found.` after `npm run ios`

<img src = './img/issue1.png' height = '300' />

**What I did:**

I went to [googled](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58562884), and installed react-native-gesture-handler.
`npm install react-native-gesture-handler --save`
afterwards, I went on to link `react-native link react-native-gesture-handler`.

But I realised my terminal do not have react native cli so i went to check on how to install.
[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37193032)

and after Installing I went to `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` 

**Issue 2**

Subsequently, I run ios again and got a new error. Which Im not able to resolved, I have checked that the imports are all correct

```Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.```
