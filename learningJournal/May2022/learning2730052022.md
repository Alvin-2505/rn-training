### Setting Up the Front End App to link up with the Back End ###

1. `unmountOnBlur` props for navigator:
  
  - In order for you to navigate back to the first tab of the tab navigator stack, we could use the `onmountOnBlur` props for the screen options and set as `true`

  - This allows you to route user back to the initial route of the tab navigator stack if he/she click logout

  - [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61488426/how-to-set-always-first-screen-of-stack-navigator-inside-tab-navigator-react-nav)

2. Set tab Icons:

  -  Use the `tabBarIcon` props in the screen options of tab navigator stack:

  - ```tabBarIcon: ({focused,color}) => ( <Icon name='list' size={20}/> )```

  - remember to import the icon: `import Icon1 from "react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons"`

  - and Add into the Info.plist, and rebuild the app again

3. Order of the Provider in `App.tsx` does not matter

4. we could make use of simulator inbuilt location simulation to run the map simulation

5. `onWillBlur` is no longer in the React Navigation v6.

  - can use the `useNavigation` hook to access navigation props;

  - and `addListener` by providing first argument as `'blur'`, second argument will be the callback fn we want to run.

6. `getParam` is no longer in the navigation props, we could deconstruct `_id` from the `route.params`.

  - in order to use the `route.params`; can use the `useRoute` hooks

7. `react-native-map` is a library which allows you to attach a map component `<Mapview>` while `Expo-location` is for the geolocation services

*Note: During this exercise, I have not have the chance to fully convert it into TypeScript; which I will do it*
