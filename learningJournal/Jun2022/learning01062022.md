### Learning about Unit Testing ###

- Test for Parent Component *Passed* but there's an console error; Attempting to fixed this issue and 2 others warnings: **Resolved**

  Fix: Wrapping my expect in `await waitFor(() => {//insert expect codes in here})` this is because in the App contains Axios hence we need to await for the result.

  Warnings Fix: [Add `jest.mock('react-native/Libraries/Animated/NativeAnimatedHelper')`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59593847)

- React Testing Library vs Jest

  - React Testing Library renders components into virtual DOM for testing

  - Jest is a test runner that 

    - find, run test and determine whether test pass or fail

- render will create a virtual DOM and access the virtual DOM using `screen` global

- `screen.getByText()` = find element by text

- Put in the element you want to search into the parenthesis

- Jest Assertions: `expect(arg1).toBeInTheDocument(arg2)`

  - `expect` method: jest global, starts the assertion

  - `arg1` : expect argument; it is used as the subject of assertion

  - `toBeInTheDocument` is a matcher, it is the type of the assertion. It comes from the Jest-DOM

  - `arg2`: sometimes there will be this argument to refine the matcher

  - more example: `expect(element.textContent).toBe('hello')`

- Jest-DOM:

  - DOM based matchers can be found in here.

  - It is where u can import the matchers from.

- How Jest works:

- Test Driven Dev:

  - Write test before code: then write code to pass the test requirements

  - red-green testing:

    - tests failed before coding: before u code ur test should be fail; and subsequently when u start to code, ur test will pass
  
  - Why do TDD?

- Functional testing: to test the behaviour of your codes; it could contain multiple of units within a behaviour
