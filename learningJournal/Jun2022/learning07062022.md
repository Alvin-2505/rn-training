## What did I learn today? ##

<!-- Type what you learnt here -->

- Test coverage: ACE

  - Acceptance testing based on user's stories/criteria

  - Code Coverage testing

  - Edge Cases

- FlatList Testing:

  **1. Test 1:**

    To test if the flatlist element is rendered when the page is first rendered.

    I also gave a mock data so as to simulate some data to be rendered

    <img src = './img/flatListTest1.png'/>

  **2. Test 2:**

    To test if the delete button works ideally by calling the method `deleteBlogPost` upon click.

    `expect(deleteBlogPost).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1)` : 
      
      `expect(deleteBlogPost)` = expect the method deleteBlogPost to have been called 
      
      `.toHaveBeenCalledWith(1)` = the method should have been called upon to delete the item id 1

    <img src = './img/flatListTest2.png'/>

  **3. Test 3:**

    To test if you click on the individual blog on the rendered flatlist, will it redirect you to that particular blog show screen

    `expect(mockNavigate).toBeCalledWith('Show', {id: 1});`

      `expect(mockNavigate)` : I expect the mockNavigate function to be called upon I press onto the blog so as to access the navigation props

      `.toBeCalledWith('Show', {id: 1});` : Upon clicking it, it should navigate me to `Show` screen, of the blog `id: 1`

    <img src = './img/flatListTest3.png'/>

- To continue my testing on other screens:

  <img src = './img/testingResult07062022.png'/>

- Have to familiarise with the various matchers for `expect`
