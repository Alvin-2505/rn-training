1. <b>Learning what is Docker</b>

    i. <b><u>What is Docker?</u></b>
    
    - Docker is used for building, running and shipping applications in consistent manner such that it can function the same way as it does in your development machine.

    - Why the applications run differently:
        - One or more files missing
        - Software version mismatch
        - different configuration settings

    - Docker allows easy package of application with everything it needs and run it anywhere with Docker.

    - If someone joins they can use `docker-compose up` to download the dependencies in a container(isolated environment). 

    - Each container can have different dependencies

    - Clean up unnecessary container and its dependencies by using `docker-compose down --rmi all`

    - `Container` vs `Virtual Machines`:
        - You can run numerous VM to run different app of different dependecies in a computer, 
        - VM need a full OS and slow to start.
        - VM are resource intensive
        - Containers are lightweight and use OS of host
        - Container can start quickly and need lesser resources 
        - Container can also run numerous app with different dependencies
