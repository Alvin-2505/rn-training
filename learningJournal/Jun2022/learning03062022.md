<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today? ##
----
<!-- Type what you learnt here -->

- Writing a test script for the blogpost form component:

  - Upon covering the component, I realised, some of the other scripts have also some % being covered.

  <img src = './img/testBlogPostForm.png' height = '450'/>

  - `fireEvent` will simulate an user action such as `press, changeText, scroll`. This API will simulate if the element will give the expected result by simulating the user's action

  - `it` and `test` is an alias of each other; they have similar function. However the main difference in using it is the readability:

    - `test(if it works, () => {});` & `it(should work, () => {});` [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45778192/what-is-the-difference-between-it-and-test-in-jest)
  
- I feel that the implementation of `getByTestId` makes it seems like we are editing the code to accomodate our testing; In this case, I feel the test first code later manner is more efficient as you could plan what your elements should contain and its expected outcome.

- For test cases, I can actually use the user stories to come up with the cases.

- `spyOn` vs `jest.fn()`:

  <img src = './img/spyOnVsJestFn.png' height = '400'/>
  
  [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57645643)

- Difficulty faced: (To continue to research)

  - Things to test in a FlatList:

    - <mark>Key Extractor: How can I test?</mark>

    - **Shall try to test on the rendering of the items first**
