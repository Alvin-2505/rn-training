### Learning about Unit Testing ###

- **If you are unsure of the role of the Element**

  - You can key in for instance `const colorButton = screen.getByRole('butt', { name: 'Change to blue'});`

  - React Testing Library will tell you there is no such element called `butt` but will suggest to you, however, there is another element that might fits your bill!

- `npm test` will run watcher which will lookout for changes in your source file so they will automatically rerun the test when they detect a change

- **Testing CSS Modules**

- Specifying which element we want in the second argument of the `getByRole` matcher; so as to refine our search in case of multiple similar elements in the component.

  - in `const colorButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Change to blue' });`, `{ name: 'Change to blue' }` is the refinement in our matcher.

- **Unit Testing Functions**

  - `describe` statement is used to group multiple tests into one group

  - When to Unit test:
