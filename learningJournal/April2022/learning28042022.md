<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today? ##

### React Native ###

- Importing lodash for quick and cleaner codes when comparing arrays, collections and objects.

- `===`, `==` are referential comparison, hence they are not comparing the values of the objects. They are used if you want to compare primitive data types. e.g. string, number

- CSS Layout elements:
  - Box Object Model
    - Padding
    - Margin
    - Border
    - Content

  <img src = './img/boxObjectModel.png' height = '300' />

  - Flexbox
    - alignItems
    - flexDirection
    - justifyContent
    - flexValues
    - alignSelf

  - Positions
    - relative: default
    - absolute: ignore the sibling element and obey parent styling
    - top, bottom, left, right: it will shift the element based on the direction and the magnitude
    - absolutefill: the child element will ignore the sibling and cover the parent element `...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject`

**Challenge 1**
I am trying to add in password validation and usage of use reducer into the password exercise yesterday.
However, when I am doing a test by typing, it kept prompting me as password field is empty whenever i type an alphabet.

*In my reducer function I have a switch case cater for empty input*

```
case ActionToDo.Empty:
            if (isEmpty(password)) {
                Alert.alert('You have not key in your password! Minimum 8 characters.');
                return initialPassword
            } else {
                return password
            }
```

*and my onChangeText prop will launch a test on the input*

```
onChangeText = {()=> {if (isEmpty(password)) {
              dispatch({type: ActionToDo.Empty, payload: password.input})
        } else {
              dispatch({type: ActionToDo.Submit, payload: password.input})
        }
```

But what this code did was to re-render whenever I type something, and it always prompt `isEmpty(password)` as true, thus, it keeps launching the empty error message when I key 1 alphabet.

I will be recoding from the start which can help me to fully understand useReducer hook further!! *I'm not giving up*
