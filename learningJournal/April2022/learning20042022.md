<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today? ##
----
<!-- Type what you learnt here -->
### React Native ###
  - Generally the states variable will be placed in the parents elements that need to read or change a state value.
  - If a child (color counter) needs to read a state value, the parent can pass it down as a prop
  - Based on the video, I have understood that the Screen.tsx will be used for us to set the states variables and the props for our reusable components to use.
  - Our reusable components will then call in the states variable as a props and do a callback function for the function that was passed in the parent element (the screen.tsx).
  - useState hook does not automatically merge and update the object

## Snippets ##
----
<!-- You can attach snippets of your end product here -->  
  - **[Before]Applying type to Props**

    <img src = './img/highlight.png' height = '300' />
  
  - **[After]Applying type to Props**

    <img src = './img/highlightAfter.png' height = '300' />

  - **Label Below Color**

    <img src = './img/labelBelowColor.png' height = '300' />

  - **After convert State to an object**

    <img src = './img/statesObject.png' height = '300' />

## Any issues I encounter? ##
----
<!-- Type Your Issues Faced today Here -->
  - Encountered props being any type and being highlighted. Since it is not advisable to use any type as it beats the purpose of TypeScript. Hence, I have to set types to the props. 
  Screenshot as shown in the second screenshot above. 
  **Thanks to Willy for the advice!**

  - Encountered the app not being able to run properly when i converted the state to an object. And went on to research more and resolved the issue. I learnt that since useState is not able to merge and update the states into the object, I have to use the spread operator inside the setState function.
  For instance: `onIncrease = {()=> setColor({ ...color, red: color.red + COLOR_INCREMENT })}`

## Reflection ##
<!-- Reflection here -->
Today I sincerely felt that one learning source will not be enough as that learning source may not be as clear and more specific in the topic it is going through.

Henceforth, it would be great to research on more sources to clarify and find out more sources. As other sources may have clearer and more specific examples in the topic they are trying to cover.

I am thankful to the fact that Anya and Janan has breakdown the topics into smaller parts. It helped slower learners like me to have the time to rewatch the Udemy video and, to pause and code alongside with the video to understand the concept better. For concepts I have doubts, I went onto Youtube, and StackOverflow to read what others have to advise.
