### React Native ###
  - **Reusable Components**
    - this features is useful as it allows you to reuse the props when required.
    - the main idea is to create a folder of all the components you will need for your app and call it into your screens.
    - In order to make it show different things based on what you want to show, you will have to add in a prop in the screen file. 
    - the attributes to the ImageDetail tag (e.g. `title` or `imageSource`) are based on what you want to call it. 
      - it allows you to set a unique identifier to your components for the pages so that you can display different stuff using the same components.
      - Do name it in a way such that fellow developers could easily understand.
      - (e.g. `<ImageDetail title = 'somethingYouWantToShow' />`)
    - we could insert `{props.title}` as the return value for the component function so that the result will appear dynamically.

      <img src = './img/propsTitle.png' height = '300' />
    
    - the **assets** folder is where you can put in image which wont't change and you wish to use it for your project.

    - the `required` statement for the image source tag is for us to provide a path to the image.

## Snippets ##

<!-- You can attach snippets of your end product here -->
  
  - **Showing that the props is different for the three components**
  
    <img src='./img/consoleScreenshot.png' height = '300'/>
  
  - **displaying images based on what we want to display**

    <img src = './img/displayingCorrect.png' height = '300' />
