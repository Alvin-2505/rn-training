<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What we do today?

Today's the first day of our apprenticeship. We mainly settled most of the administrative for the onboarding today. 
<br/>
We have also set up the laptop today to prepare us for the React Native lesson for 40 days in before we started our on-the-job training.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In order to get us started we were being briefed as a group by Anya and Russell. We each have 1 minute to share about ourselves to break the ice.

We were be doing hybrid learning using Udemy and sharings by Anya.

We have also been given a framework on what will be covered for each lesson. It gives us a better idea on what to expect.

## Usage

As part of our setting up for the technical lessons, we have also done the github setting up. It helps us to refresh our memories on git commands which will be extensively used when we will be pushing updates into the repo.
