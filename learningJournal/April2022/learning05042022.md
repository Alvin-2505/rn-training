<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today?
Today we are supposed to learn the TypeScript language.
However, my set-up has some issues which causes the mobile app simulation not able to be booted.
Thankfully, with the help of Willy, Anya, Janan and Russell, I have managed to debug after using the whole day to try to debug..
Nonetheless, there are still some stuff which I have learnt and understand:
<br/>
1. Reason not to use capital letters in the package name: To avoid conflict with the Java Class.
2. Components of the package.json:
    1. the scripts component will consist of the command you to key in in order to run a certain action
    2. dependencies component will define the modules version that your project will be depending on.
    3. devDependencies component are the packages we installed for development purposes.
    4. The resolution component will specify the dependency and version to be used.
3. In VSCode, under package.json, we can hover the standard properties to view the description.

## What issue did I encounter?

1. I not sure what I am supposed to do for the 'type code’ step initially and thanks to Willy whom shared the link of opening VSCode using terminal command.
<br />2. After installing the required stuff and running npm run iOS, I have encountered the error of building up the IOS app. I have sought for Willy's, Anya’s and Janan's help and also researched in google to find out possible fixes.
