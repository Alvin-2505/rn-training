### React Native ###
  1. **Recap on Reusable Components**
    - Passing the props as the argument in the component details page to allow the components to show dynamically onto the screens page.
    
    - Remember to also add in the require statement for the image source path in the prop in the screen page. 
  
  2. **States Management**
      - **States vs Props**
        - **Props**

          - Pass data from parent (Screen) to child (Components)

        - **States**
          - Track a Piece of data that change over time. When the data changes, our app will re-render.

          - Remember to always `import {useState} from "react"` whenever you need to set a new state variable.
      
      - **Example: Counter app**
        
        - **What piece of data is changing in the app**
          - The counts each time you press the Increase or Decrease button
        
        - **What type of data is it?**
          - It is a number
        
        - **Default Value of the data**
          - 0

      - **Why do you not set counter as 0 and do counter ++ or --?**

        - This is because React will not reflect the changes when you click on the increase/decrease button. But in fact, behind the scene, the counter variable is actually changing based on the clicks on the buttons. *Refer to Screenshot: Counter Before* By using the State variable, React will watch the changes for us and reflect it onto the screens.    

        - **Never** modify the State variable directly

        - You can name the state variable anything you want as long as it is easily understandable what is it for
