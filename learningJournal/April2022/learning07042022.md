<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today? ##
----
### Object Types ###
1. **Interface**
  - Examples of an Interface:

   ```
  interface Game {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  genre: string;
  price: number;
  audience_rating: string;
  }

  //using arrow function and union types
  const gameDetails = (game:Game): (string|number) => {
    return `Welcome to my Game Database! \n
    Game Name: ${game.name},\n 
    Game ID: ${game.id},\n
    Genre: ${game.genre},\n
    Price: $${game.price}0,\n
    Suitable for ${game.audience_rating}`
  };
  console.log(gameDetails({name: 'March of the Devils', id: '3010', genre:'Adventure', price:39.90, audience_rating:'PG13'}));
  //try creating a new game instance object
  const game1: Game = {name: 'Devils May Rest', id: '3020', genre:'Adventure',  price:39.90, audience_rating:'PG-13'};
  console.log(gameDetails(game1)); 
  //also works
  ```

   - I feel that the Interface and Type Alias way is pretty similar in naming an object type.

   - By defining the same interface multiple times, you are able to merge the definitions

2. **Types**
   - Examples:
   
  ```
  // using Types Alias
  type GameType = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  genre: string;
  price: number;
  audience_rating: string;
  }
  const gameDetailsType = (gameType: GameType): string|number =>{
    return `Welcome to my Type Alias Game Database!\n
    Game Name: ${gameType.name},\n
    Game ID: ${gameType.id},\n
    Genre: ${gameType.genre},\n
    Price: $${gameType.price}0,\n
    Suitable for ${gameType.audience_rating}`
  };
  const gameType1: GameType = {name:'Breath of the Fire', id: '4010', genre:'JRPG', price: 49.90,audience_rating:'PG-13'};
  console.log(gameDetailsType(gameType1));
   ```

   - You won't be able to merge the definitions by declaring the same type alias multiple times.

3. **Property Modifier**
    1. Optional Properties
      - by using the ? operator, the properties of the object type will be optional. Even if no input for the optional properties, it will be valid

    2. Readonly Properties
      - this properties only allows reading, but u cannot update this properties directly after initialising.

4. **Extend**
   - Firstly, when u want to create a new interface with additional properties from an existing interface, you would not want to re-key in all the existing properties into your new interface. so you could just extends your new interface into the existing interface.

   - Secondly, u can build a new interface by extending into two existing interface (abit like concatenating concept)

5. **Intersection**
   - Intersections is similar whereby u can build a new object types using existing types.

### Class ###

- The concept of class is important to grasp.
  1. defining a class (e.g. class Human{})
  2. You can use a definite assignment assertion operator !: to skip initialising in the constructor of the class.
  3. Constructors **CANNOT** have type param or return type annotation
  4. If there is a base class, you will have to call super inb4 using any this.members
  5. function properties in a class are known as **Methods**.
  6. Access Modifiers: public, private.
  7. getter and setter to access the private properties
  
- Although I have no question so far for class. I will still need to practise more

## Questions I encounter? ##
----
1. **What are the difference between using type alias vs interface?**

  - this two object types are very similar except when you wish to extend the properties, for type alias u are not able to use extends to do so. in this case, you would have to use intersection, &.

2. **The usage of unknown is still not very clear to me**

   - I am aware that unknown is a safer approach than any as it will prevent accidental calling of a datatype method. I will need to see more codes in order to understand the real world usage of unknown.

3. **Intersection and extends**

   - these two ways are similar and I read that the difference is in the way they handled conflicts. This is the area which I need to read more on.
