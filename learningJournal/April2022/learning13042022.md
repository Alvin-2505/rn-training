<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today? ##
----
<!-- Type what you learnt here -->
### React Native ###
  - `TouchableOpacity`
    - TouchableOpacity is a wrapper to handle touches so as to provide a touch effect on element wrapped within it.
    - With no customisation, it will just look like a string of text. When you click on the element, then you will see the change in opacity of the wrapped element.
    - you will have to provide some level of styling in order for it to look like a button 
    - this would be good if you have to provide heavy customisation to your buttons
    - also, despite opacity changed when you click, you will have to add an event handler for press actions to be taken.

  - `Button`
    - Button provide very minimal level of customisation. 
    - you are able yo use it 'out of the box'
    - you can always build a button or visit the community for their source code of their custom buttons: https://js.coach/?search=button&collection=React+Native

  - `Pick`
    - Helper function in TypeScript to pick the properties based on the condition. (i.e. from T **pick** the set of properties that are in union type K)

  - `flex`
    - The concept of flex in the styling is very important which I will need to practise more

  - `navigation`
    - it helps to assign a navigation event to the button

### Time Management ###
  - TimeBoxing: 
    - To allocate a set amount of time for an issue so that you can focus on priorities taskings and not be held up by 1 bug/issues!
    
## Snippets ##
----
<!-- You can attach snippets of your end product here -->
  
  - **Show FlatList as Table**
    
    <img src = './img/ButtonList.png' height = '300' />
  
  - **Component Screen using Touch Opacity**

    <img src = './img/touchableOpacity.png' height = '300' />

  - **Home Screens using the Button**

    <img src = './img/ButtonHome.png' height = '300' />

## Any issues I encounter? ##
----
<!-- Type Your Issues Faced today Here -->
  - Special thanks to Willy for helping me in coming up with the code to present the FlatList in the form of a table.

  - I will need to practise more on the styling to achieve the effects i want and to familiarise with the different properties.
