<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What did I learn today? ##
----
### React Native ###
1. **JSX**
  - JSX in my opinion, gives developer the flexibility as it resembles the hybrid of HTML and JS coding manner.
  - I went to see in Babel.JS if I were to code the JSX codes in pure JS language, it will be longer and won't be as easy to read and maintain.

2. **React Component File**
  - A React Component file will consist of 4 parts
    - First: Libraries to be imported
    - Second: Component -> it is a function that returns a JSX
    - Third: StyleSheet to style the component
    - Fourth: Export the component so we could import in another component in our project!
    - I like how the results would show instantaneously after you save the codes.

3. **React Native Core Components**
  1. `View`
  2. `Text`
  3. `Image`
  4. `ScrollView`
  5. `TextInput`

4. **Challenge Practise**

## Any issues I encounter? ##
----
1. Initially I encountered some issue while creating two blocks of text, but later on I understand that I have to use a View tab to wrap up the two Text components.

2. I am interested in the React Native Animation component
