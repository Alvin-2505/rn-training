### React Native ###

1. useReducer
  - Like useState, you can use useReducer to change the state value.
  - it takes in a reducer with state, action types and return current state with a dispatch method.
  - the dispatch method is like the setState method in useState as we are not to change the states directly, we have to use these methods to update our states value.
  - the dispatch method is can be known as runMyReducer method.
  - A reducer is a function of what you wish to do to your states.

## Any issues I encounter? ##

<!-- Type Your Issues Faced today Here -->
1. After using the useReducer, I am not able to make the reset button work.

2. I am still finding it difficult to understand useReducer.

**Update**
I have managed to resolve for the reset button through trial and error and this process allows me to understand the reducer more. 
What I did was to read the codes again, and I found that they use the dispatch to adjust states.
In other words, the dispatch function is similar to the setState function.
Then I have to go over to my switch cases and add in a case `reset` with the functionality of setting state back to 0 using the following codes `{...state, red: amount, green: amount, blue: amount}`

<img src='./img/switchCode.png' height = '300' />

Now I have to go over to my `<TouchableOpacity>` codes to add an onPress action for the reset button by inserting colorToChange as reset and my amount as 0.

<img src='./img/resetCode.png' height = '300' />
